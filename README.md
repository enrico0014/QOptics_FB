# Quantum Optics near a Photonic Flat Band

_Flat Bands_ (FBs) are a special type of energy bands, which can occur in natural and artificial lattices. Unlike standard bands, FBs are _dispersionless_, i.e. particles occupying such a band have _zero_ velocity at any wavelength. Remarkably, a FB has a macroscopically large degeneracy, making it extremely sensitive to small perturbations.
This project will explore the effect of FBs in quantum optics, which can be experimentally observed in engineered photonic lattices coupled to artificial atoms. A major goal will be to exploit the emerging physics as a resource for new applications of _quantum technologies_ such as simulation of complex many-body spin Hamiltonians and quantum metrology.
In particular, we plan to investigate FBs coupled to so called _giant atoms_, a new type of artificial quantum emitter which interacts with the field _non-locally_, i.e. at many distinct coupling points.
